Using your HelloLeads CRM app, you can reduce the time taken for sending the formal messages or texts to your leads or customers in a repeat fashion. You can create a set of custom message templates for each scenario - for example, request for a demo, meeting requests and sharing pricing details.
These sales communication situations are repetitive and hence we have created message templates for you, to save time.You can use your custom message templates when you WhatsApp, text or email your leads and customers for various purposes. You can create multiple templates as you need and the templates are user specific and device specific.

Creating a Custom Message Template:
To access, WhatsApp Menu > Settings > “WhatsApp & Texting Templates”.

To create a message template, click [+] at bottom of the screen, name your template, add a message that you want to share with your leads/ customer and save.
You can make your message or text more personalized by adding place holders like #LeadName# and #LeadCompanyName# to your message template.
For example, your lead name is Matt Moris and his company name is Manhattan Associates, the text template and its result will look like this.

Sending Custom Messages to Leads:
HelloLeads CRM harnesses the power of communication to your advantage. When you click the email, text/message or WhatsApp from the action circles in your lead detail page, a list of saved templates will be presented and you can choose the required message or text template to be sent to your lead or customer.
